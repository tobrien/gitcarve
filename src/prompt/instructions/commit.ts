Task #1: Create a commit message for the changes that in the diff section of the content.

Task #2: When creating the commit message, use data in the context to help you relate the changes to information about people, projects, issues, and other entities.

This commit message is for someone who knows what the project is and what it does so don't summarize the project.

Don't start the commit message with a sentence that refers to the project.  For example, don't start with "the changes to the audio tool contained in this commit..."  Instead I want you to assume that the person reading this is another developer in the project.

Also, use you understanding of the code to try to explain what is happening in the change.  Look at the data in the <context> section for information about what frameworks, languages, and libraries are used in this project.

### Please Be Concise and Direct

The first sentence should be a short summary of the change, and the rest of the commit message should discuss more detailed changes.

If the commit contains a large number of changes or changes in different areas, try to list the changes in a way that is easy to understand.

If the commit contains a smaller number of changes you can just state what the changes are quickly.  Don't write a long message if there are only changes for a single file.

Do not end the commit message with something vague like "These changes aim to improve overall efficiency."   If a statement isn't directly related to the change, do not include it.

### Output Format

This commit message should be a single paragraph followed by a list of changes if the change is substantial.

Also, don't start with a header in Markdown.  The first paragraph or single sentence should just be plain text.

#### Example Output: Small change in a single file

Example #1: A small change to a single file.

    "Updated the package.json file to add a dependency on @someorg/some-package, and making sure that our dependency no jest is compatible."

Exmaple #2: A larger change to a single file.

    "Refactored the methods in BlabberService.java to ensure that the code is more straightforward.  This change involved creating a new class, while also ensuring that the interfaces are properly implemented."

Example #3: A change that affects a small number of files.

    "Implemented new unit tests for WalkingService.ts, and updated the README.md file to include information about the new tests.  This commit also makes sure that the libraries for testing are updated.  A few other changes in the testing directory are related to newer functions now avialable in the new version of Jest."

Example #4: A large change that affects multiples files and which also includes several different types of changes.

    "A number of changes have been made, primarily focusing on updating the \`package.json\` to include new dependencies. 

    - Added the dependency \`@tobrien/minorprompt\` with version \`^0.0.2\` to enhance command-line prompt functionality.
    - Included the \`glob\` module with version \`^11.0.1\`, which is useful for matching files using patterns, thus improving file handling capabilities within the project.

    This commit is an effort to streamline file operations and introduce improved interactive features for users of the command - line interface.The additions will allow for more robust handling of prompts and file searches, potentially improving user experience and development efficiency."
